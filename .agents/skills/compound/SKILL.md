description: Distill reusable lessons from completed work into a durable artifact under `./.agent-harness/compounds`. Use when a task, review, or verification pass produced durable insights worth preserving for future agent runs.
---

Turn completed work into a compact reusable lesson artifact.

Your job is to capture only the high-value lessons that are likely to help future agent passes avoid repeating discovery work.

Behavior:

1. Determine the source material:
   - a completed task or PRD item
   - a review or verification result
   - a sequence of agent notes or implementation passes
2. Extract reusable knowledge, not a diary:
   - conventions learned from the repo
   - pitfalls encountered and how they were resolved
   - commands or verification flows that proved reliable
   - constraints that future work must preserve
3. Ignore low-value noise:
   - temporary debugging details
   - one-off errors with no future relevance
   - information that is already obvious from the code
4. Write the result to `./.agent-harness/compounds/<topic-kebab-case>.md`.
   - create `./.agent-harness/compounds` if it does not exist
   - choose a stable topic name based on the feature or lesson domain
5. Return the saved content in the response as well.

Compounding rules:

- Keep the artifact short and skimmable.
- Prefer bullets over prose paragraphs.
- Focus on lessons that change future execution decisions.
- Include file paths or commands only when they materially improve reuse.
- If there is not enough durable insight yet, say so and do not force an artifact.

Output format:

- Topic
- Why it matters
- Learned constraints
- Recommended patterns
- Avoid next time
- References

Artifact template:

```md
# <Topic>

## Why it matters
- ...

## Learned constraints
- ...

## Recommended patterns
- ...

## Avoid next time
- ...

## References
- `path/to/file`
- `command --flag`
```
