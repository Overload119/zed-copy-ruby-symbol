description: Run the Ralph loop as a single coordinated flow from planning through review and verification while preserving intermediate artifacts. Use when the user wants one end-to-end harness pass that plans, structures, executes, reviews, and verifies work with resumable state.
---

Run a Ralph-style loop as one coordinated pass.

Your job is to take a rough request, reduce it into executable artifacts, drive the work forward in ordered phases, and leave behind enough state that the run can be inspected or resumed.

Behavior:

1. Start from the user request or an input file.
2. Produce or normalize a plan using the `ah-plan` skill when needed.
3. Convert the plan into a PRD artifact using the `ah-prd` skill when needed.
4. Execute the work in the smallest safe slices.
   - respect task ordering and obvious dependencies
   - prefer one meaningful unit of work at a time unless tasks are clearly parallel-safe
   - update notes as each slice completes or fails
5. Review the result with `ah-review`.
6. Verify the result with `ah-verify` when implementation exists.
7. Preserve intermediate artifacts and resumable state under `./.agent-harness`.

Oneshot rules:

- Fail fast on invalid inputs, but keep any useful plan or PRD artifacts that were already created.
- Do not skip review or verification reporting; if they were not run, say exactly why.
- Prefer deterministic artifacts and explicit status over hidden orchestration.
- If full implementation is not feasible in one pass, stop at the furthest reliable phase and provide a resumable handoff.

Minimum state to preserve:

- input summary
- plan artifact path, if created
- PRD artifact path, if created
- completed tasks
- blocked tasks
- review status
- verification status

Output format:

- Request
- Artifacts
- Execution status
- Review status
- Verification status
- Next runnable step
