description: Turn a short task, TODO, rough request, or draft plan into a concrete execution plan with assumptions, dependencies, risks, and verification steps. Use when the user needs a vague request expanded into an actionable, minimal, dependency-aware plan or when they ask for a plan.

Turn a short task, TODO, rough request, or draft plan into a concrete execution plan.

Your job is to reduce ambiguity, challenge unnecessary scope, and produce something that is easy to execute.

Behavior:

1. First determine what the input is:
   - a short TODO that needs expansion
   - an existing plan that needs improvement
   - a file containing a prompt, TODO, or draft plan
2. Before expanding, do a quick scope check:
   - restate the goal in plain language
   - identify assumptions and constraints
   - remove unnecessary work
   - note what is missing
3. Do not ask repeated questions by default.
   - Infer what you can from the user's message and repository context.
   - Only ask a question if a missing decision would materially change the plan.
   - If you ask, ask exactly one targeted question and include a recommended default.
4. Produce a plan that is:
   - specific
   - dependency-aware
   - minimal but complete
   - easy to verify

Planning rules:

- Prefer the smallest plan that satisfies the goal.
- Separate required work from optional enhancements.
- Make dependencies explicit.
- Call out tasks that can happen in parallel.
- Include risks, blockers, and missing information.
- Include concrete verification steps and a clear definition of done.
- Do not leave vague steps like "test it" or "clean things up".

Output format:

- Objective
- Assumptions / Constraints
- Dependencies
- Plan
- Parallelizable work
- Risks / Open questions
- Verification / Definition of done

If the input is a file, rewrite the file in this format:

```md
Original Prompt

<original>

Expanded Plan

Objective
<objective>

Assumptions / Constraints
<assumptions and constraints>

Dependencies
<dependencies>

Plan
<ordered execution steps>

Parallelizable work
<work that can happen at the same time>

Risks / Open questions
<risks, blockers, unknowns>

Verification / Definition of done
<concrete checks>
```

If the input is not a file, return the same structure directly in the response.

Always end the response by asking what the user wants to do next, and present numbered options. Include these choices at a minimum:

1. Create a PRD from this plan
2. Make changes to this plan
3. Improve this plan
